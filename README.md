# coinbase
ETL project for coinbase data science internship application 

GOAL: 
For this project I wish to create a real-time crypto price dashboard. I will connect to the coinbase API, transform and write that data to a database, and then visualize/present that data for a user to access. 

STEPS: 
1. Create coinbase account to get an api_key 
2. Test the api connection by fetching data 
3. Create a cloud database (on railway, AWS, Azure)
4. Test that the database has the correct + desired data
5. Create a front end framework to show the realtime stream 
6. Format + curate a visualization / dashboard for the crypto price
7. Publish and observe! 

TOOLS: 
Git 
scripting + querying : python, postgreSQL with psycopg2 library
cloud stuff: AWS
front-end framework: django ? Power BI ? TBD 

NOTES: 
crypto price to track [NEAR protocol](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/near-protocol/)
